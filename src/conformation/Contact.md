# Contact

We have investigated correlation between contact intensity and bendability.

## Experiments

**Research Question**
Are contact intensity and bendability correlated?

We can measure contact intensity at a bp in various ways

- Within it's own resolution, e.g. 4800-4800
- Sum of with own + adjacent resolution, e.g. 4800-4400, 4800-4800, 4800-5200
- Sum of with all, e.g. 4800-\*

## Results

Correlation between Intensity (400 bp) and Chr V actual C0 
| Intensity | Pearsons | Spearmans |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Own | 0.05 | 0.05 |
| Adjacent | | |
