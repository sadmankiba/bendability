Hi-C matrix data is downloaded from [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE151553) 


## Additional Information 
Hiccups algorithm of Juicer tools require GPU. So, Google Colab was used to run this algorithm. The notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1D4lRnORwSygnOBksHkx6PXHz0a5nHEer?usp=sharing).
