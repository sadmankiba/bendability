## Data  

The following data are used.

1. In `bendability/`,
Measured Intrinsic Cyclizability from [Measuring DNA mechanics on the genome scale](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03052-3) paper. 

2. In `loops/` and `boundaries/`,
Chromatin conformation data generated with `Juicer Tools` and `HiCExplorer`. 
Hi-C data of Yeast is taken from [Cohesin residency determines chromatin loop patterns](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE151553) paper. It was derived with Micro-C XL.  

3. In `nucleosome_position/`,
Nucleosome center positions from [A map of nucleosome positions in yeast at base-pair resolution](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11142?page=3)

4. In `yeast_genome`,
Reference genome sequence of S. Cerevisiae downloaded from [Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD)](https://www.yeastgenome.org/)

5. In `gene/`,
Yeast gene locations and UTRs from [YeastMine](https://yeastmine.yeastgenome.org/yeastmine/begin.do) in Saccharomyces Genome Database. 

## Modifications

Changed headers in each bendability dataset to separate `Sequence #` from `Sequence` by tab.
