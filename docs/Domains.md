# Domains

## Experiments

**Research Question**

We ask whether TADs and boundaries share a common property in terms of bendability. 

**Method**

We identify domains and boundaries from 500bp resolution Hi-C data. A bp is either in a domain or in a boundary. A boundary = single pixel = 500 bp. 

We predict bendability of short sequences of all chromosomes in yeast. We then measure bendability of long sequences. 

## Results

Out of 16 chromosomes, In 15, domains are less bendable than boundaries. [?] 

Relation: Taekjip Ha group showed that promoter regions are more bendable. It is a known fact that boundaries reside in promoter regions (~70% in our analysis). So, boundaries are ought to be more bendable. 

Out of 16 chromosomes, In all 16, promoter boundaries > domains. In 13, non-promoter boundaries > domains. [?]
