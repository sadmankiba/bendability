# Loops

## Experiments

**Research Question**

We ask whether bendability of sequences within loops are more bendable or less bendable. 

**Methods**

We predict bendability of sequences of all chromosomes in Yeast using our model. From these short sequences, we measure average bendability of long regions such as within loops or not within loops. Considering all chromosomes, sequences in loop = 80%, in non-loop = 20%. [?]

## Results

Out of 16 chromosomes, In 14 (87.5 %), loop regions are less bendable than non-loop regions. [1]

Among total x loops, m loops (?) are less bendable than seq outside loops. [?]
