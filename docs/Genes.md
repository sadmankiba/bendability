# Genes 

Experiments of C0 in genes.

## Acronyms

PM = Promoters
PMwB = Promoters with boundaries
PMoB = Promoters without boundaries
BN = Boundaries
BNiP = Boundaries in promoters
BNnP = Boundaries not in promoters
CH = Chromosome

## Method

## Probability distribution of C0 in various comb. of promoters and boundaries

**Procedure**
Prob. dist / density of C0 in PM, BN, PM/B, BN/P, CH

**Observations**
- Promoters in general, have a preference for higher bendability. This preference is present in promoters without boundaries but not in those with boundaries. Rather, promoters that form boundaries have a visible preference for rigidity. 
- Boundaries, both in and not in promoters, show similar distribution. In-promoter ones are more concentrated near avg.
