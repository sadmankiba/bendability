# Promoters

## Acronyms
PMwD = Promoters with NDR 
PMoD = Promoters without NDR

## Number and C0 of promoters with and without NDR 

**Procedure**
Promoters with and without any linkers >= 80 bp were considered. [C1, C2][F1, F2]

**Observations**
*Number*
- With NDRs 100 (40%), without NDRs 150 (60%)

*C0*
In chr V actual, 
- PMoD are more likely to havehigh bendability - a local hill in higher C0 (-0.05).
- PMwD show typical bell curve. Probably becz low C0 at NDRs and high C0s cancel out. A slight tendency for rigidity - the curve is steeper on high C0 side. 

## Prob distrib of linkers length in promoters 

**Procedure**
Length of linkers completely within promoters. [C3][F3]

**Future Directions**
