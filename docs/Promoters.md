# Promoters

## Acronyms
PMwD = Promoters with NDR 
PMoD = Promoters without NDR

## Comparison of bendability of promoters with and without NDR 

**Procedure**
Promoters with and without any linkers >= 80 bp were considered. [C1][F1]

**Observations**
In chr V actual, 
- PMoD are more likely to havehigh bendability - a local hill in higher C0 (-0.05).
- PMwD show typical bell curve. Probably becz low C0 at NDRs and high C0s cancel out. A slight tendency for rigidity - the curve is steeper on high C0 side. 

**Future Directions**
- Num of PMwD and PMoD
