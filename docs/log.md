| 4/05 | Verify motif enrichment in boundaries with k-mer line and box plot. (poly-A matches. others less). Check nuc lnk motif enrichment. Similar to boundary. |
| 1/05 | Plot MC line c0 boundary. Use updated motif enrichment score. |
| 25/04| Check line C0 at boundaries. Align nearest NDR mids as boundary mids. |
| 23/04| Show NDR line C0 in boundaries and domains with partitions. |
| 01/03| Sorted motifs by enrichment and de-enrichment in boundaries | 
| 27/02| Among ML models, best prediction by liner model with l2 regularization, Ridge | 
| 8/02 | Bndry NDR more bendable. Contributing Kmer distrib in bndry not clear. Helsep refactored. |
| 4/02 | Worked to modularize hel sep | 
| 3/02 | Box plot mean c0 of combined bndrs, nucs, lnkrs in chromosome V. | 

## Weekly Log

**Apr 23 - Apr 27**
Results 
- NDR line inconsistent in small 2 ranges (11-30, 31-50) in boundaries and domains. 
- NDR line seemed rigid in big 2 ranges (51-70, 71-90). This is also less consistent. 

TO-DO
- Clarify bendability at NDRs. 
- Clarify why is our found motifs better?

**Apr 30 - May 04**
TO-DO
- Write thesis. 

**May 7 - May 10**
TO-DO 
- Write thesis. 
## Short Tasks TO-DO List
### Priority - High
(Figure: Prob distrib of distance of linker middles from boundary middles)

**Check motifs in boundaries** 

Created: 8/02. Done: 100%<br>
Result: Some motifs are enriched and de-enriched in boundaries.

**Check helsep of bndrs, bndry nucs, bndry ndrs, bndry prmtrs** 

Created: 4/02. Done: 80%<br>
Result: Checked helsep in boundary. It's noisy and not understandable. Not sure how to present.

**Rigidity - FANC Bndry (+- 250bp, +-100bp, +-50bp), Bndry prmtrs, bndry nucs, bndry ndrs. Box plot. With nuc, linkers.**

Created: 3/02. Done: 3/02 <br>
Result: Bndrs more bndbl. bndry nucs more rigid. bndry lnkrs more bndbl. |

### Priority - Medium 
**Boundaries, NDR: How many? Dist distrib?** 

Created: 15/01. Done: 15/01 <br>
Result: ~90% FAN-C top 25% bndry has NDR in +-300 bp**

**NDR: Rigid? Sharp dip in C0?** 

Created: 15/01. Done: 15/01

### Priority - Low
**Besides dinc, check 3-mer, 4-mer of bndrs regions** 

Created: 4/02. Done: 50%  


## Table: Long-Term Tasks 
| Task                              |  Complete  | Comments |
| ----------------------------------| -----------|
| Present our results more clearly  |  20% |  
| Strengthen motif discovery by verifying with chrm conf property | 20% |
| Finalize story about Chrm Conf and bendability | 60% |
| Finalize boundary positions<br> - Which best - FAN-C or Hi-C Exp?<br>- At which res?- Which top %? <br>- Should we mix?       |     70% (not priority)       | Will use Fan-C |
| Find motifs of bendability | 70% |
| Mutation (maybe not) |  | 
| Evolutionary conservation. |  |
