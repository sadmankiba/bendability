| 3/02 | Box plot mean c0 of combined bndrs, nucs, lnkrs in chromosome V. | 

## Table: Long-Term Tasks 
| Task                              |  Complete  |
| ----------------------------------| -----------|
| Finalize boundary positions<br> - Which best - FAN-C or Hi-C Exp?<br>- At which res?- Which top %? <br>- Should we mix?       |     70% (not priority)       |
| Finalize story about Chrm Conf and bendability | |
| Find motifs of bendability | |
| Strengthen motif discovery by verifying with chrm conf property |  |
| Mutation (maybe not) |  | 
| Evolutionary conservation. |  |

## Short Tasks List   
| Task | Priority | Created | Compl | Result | 
| -----|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| Besides dinc, check 3-mer, 4-mer of bndrs regions | L | 4/02 | | |  
| Check helsep of bndrs, bndry nucs, bndry ndrs, bndry prmtrs | H | 4/02 | | |
| Rigidity - FANC Bndry (+- 250bp, +-100bp, +-50bp), Bndry prmtrs, bndry nucs, bndry ndrs. Box plot. With nuc, linkers. | H | 3/02 | 3/02 | bndrs more bndbl. bndry nucs more rigid. bndry lnkrs more bndbl. |
| Boundaries, NDR: How many? Dist distrib? | M | 15/01 | 15/01 | ~90% FAN-C top 25% bndry has NDR in +-300 bp |  
| NDR: Rigid? Sharp dip in C0? | 15/01 | M | 15/01 | | |
